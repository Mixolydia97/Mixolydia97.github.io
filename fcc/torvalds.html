		<h3>Early Life and First Computers</h3>
		<p>Linus Torvalds is the son of Anna and Nils Torvalds. He was born in Helsinki, Finlands on December 28, 1969. His first experience with programming was on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a>. He later used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclaire QL</a> and, because of the difficulty of getting software, he wrote his own assembler, editor, and games for the system.</p>
		<h3>Education and the Linux Kernel</h3>
		<p>Torvalds began attending the University of Helsinki in 1988. Between 1989 and 1990, Torvalds put his education on hold in order to join the Finnish military and fulfill his military service requirement. In 1991 he purchased an i386 IBM PC which was capable of running MINIX, a minimal version of UNIX designed for educational purposes. It was on this computer that Torvalds began developing the Linux kernel. He released the first version of the kernel later in 1991. Torvalds graduated from university in 1996 with a master's degree in computer science. His thesis was written about the kernel he was developing.

		<h3>Work</h3>
		<p>Torvalds' first job out of college was with Transmeta, a microprocessor manufacturer in California. He was allowed to continue working on the Linux kernel while working at Transmeta from 1997 to 2003. Torvalds then left Transmeta to work for the Open Source Development Labs (later merged with the Free Standards Group to form the Linux Foundation). 

		<h3>Today</h3>
		<p>Torvalds continues his work as a maintainer of the Linux kernel. You can see his GitHub profile <a href="https://github.com/torvalds">here</a>. You can also check his Wikipedia page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">here</a>, although the majority of the information contained in his Wikipedia page appears on this website.</p>
